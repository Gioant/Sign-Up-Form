Simple sign up form completely validated via javascript (Client-side).

Every input has it's own logic for validation so the user cannot make an error.

for example:

- Name inputs can only enter numbers & first letter is always capitalize
- Phone number can only allow numbers and automatically formats the input to canadian phone numbers (10 digits)
- Email is validated by making sure that the user enters something with an "@something.com" format
- password & confirm password must match


Also, this form is completely responsive for every device (Mobile,tablet,desktop)
